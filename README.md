RemoteTechReTooled
==================

RTRT is a fork of RemoteTech with the primary goal of simplifying some of the more complex features and making the functions more accessible by other mods, first and foremost, by Kerbal Konstructs.

RTRT is unlikely to be in a compilable or releasable state at any time soon and is currently a code dump for changes I'd like to make to RemoteTech but do not want to push over at that.

This fork is licensed GPLv2, as per the original licence for RemoteTech.
